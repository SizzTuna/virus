# virus
Alrighty, here;s what you've got to do to make it work. It's a lot of stuff, so bear with me.
First, download all the stuff and extract it.
Then, rename the two "virus-main" folders to simply "virus".
Inside the same folder that all the program files are in, make a new folder titled "Application Files".
Inside that, make another new folder titled "virus_1_0_0_2".
Now, move every file except "autorun" "setup" and "virus" into the "virus_1_0_0_2" folder.
Now that everything's set up, you should be able to run "setup" to download the virus-- I mean, application. You might have to bypass Windows Defender for this.
DISCLAIMER: This file is not meant to be malicious, but you maybe kinda have to restart your laptop to get rid of the window it pops up. So just keep that in mind!
